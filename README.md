# Instrumentation Database (SQL Server)
This repository contains the SQL Server Schema for an instrumentation database designed to manage information about instrumentation devices in a gas refinery or similar industrial setting.
## Description 
This database schema provides a structured way to store and manage data related to Instrumentation devices, including their general information, performance specifications, environmental characteristics, electrical details, process connections, calibration and maintenance records, and documentation. 
The database is designed to be comprehensive and flexible, allowing for efficient tracking, analysis, and reporting of Instrumentation data. 
## Key Features 
** Comprehensive Data Storage ** Stores a wide range of information about Instrumentation devices, including device details, specifications, maintenance history, and documentation. 
** Normalized Schema ** The schema is normalized to reduce data redundancy and improve data constituency. 
** SQL Server Compatibility ** The schema is designed specifically for SQL Server. 
** Extensive Design ** The schema can be easily extended to accommodate additional data fields or tables as needed. 
## Tables 
The database consists of the following tables: 
**DeviceInfo** Contains general information about each instrument, such as DeviceID, TagNumber, DeviceType, Manufacturer, ModelNumber, InstallationDate, etc. 
**MaintenanceHistory** Stores a history of maintenance activities performed on each instrument. 
*DocumentationDrawings** Contains references to datasheets, installation manuals, loop diagrams, and P&ID references for each instrument. 
## Getting Started 
1. Download the SQL script.
   Download the SQL Server script.
2. Open the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
   Open in SSMS and connect to your SQL Server instance.
3. Create the database
   You may need to create a new database first:
   sql
   CREATE DATABASE InstrumentationDB;
   GO
   USE InstrumentationDB;
   GO
4. Execute the Script.
   Open the downloaded SQL script in SSMS and execute it. This will create the tables and define relationships.
